# Ethical Keylogger – Educational Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates keystroke logging in a strictly ethical and
educational manner. It captures text typed only into the application itself
and only after explicit user consent.

## Features
- Application-scoped keystroke capture
- Explicit user consent
- Local logging only
- Log viewer
- No background monitoring
- No system-wide hooks

## Ethical Considerations
System-wide keylogging can be misused. This project intentionally avoids
global OS hooks to ensure privacy and ethical compliance.

## Learning Outcomes
- Input handling concepts
- Secure local logging
- Ethical cybersecurity practices

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only and is not intended for
malicious use or unauthorized monitoring.
